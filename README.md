### VEDA <-> Jupyterhub

We will use this repository to publicly track work related to JupyterHub and integration into the VEDA environment.

Track issues, feature requests, bug reports as Issues in this repository.

For architecture decisions and longer term documents, use the `documents` folder in this repository.

Specific work will likely happen in different repositories - we will use this space to define higher level goals, and track issues and use-cases that might span work across multiple repositories.

(TODO: Expand README with links to relevant repositories / keep updated as the project grows)
